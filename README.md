Full Stack Auth Application (CodeIgniter 4 + React)
This project is a complete full-stack web application featuring a CodeIgniter 4 REST API for the backend and a React.js single-page application for the frontend. It demonstrates user registration, token-based (JWT) authentication, and protected data fetching with a clean, modern UI.

‚ú® Features
Secure User Authentication: Full Register and Login functionality.

Token-Based API: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure API endpoints.

1-to-1 Database Relationship: Demonstrates a relationship between a users table and a teachers profile table.

CRUD Functionality: A single API endpoint to create user and teacher profiles simultaneously.

Data Visualization: Protected pages display user and teacher data in sortable, filterable data tables.

Responsive UI: A clean and creative user interface built with React.

Separated Concerns: Independent backend API and frontend client for better scalability and maintenance.

Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:

XAMPP or WAMP (for Apache & MySQL)

Composer (getcomposer.org)

Node.js and npm (nodejs.org)

‚öôÔ∏è 1. Backend Setup (ci4-auth-api)
Clone the Repository

Bash

git clone <your-backend-repo-url>
cd ci4-auth-api
Install Dependencies

Bash

composer install
Configure Environment

Rename the env file to .env.

Update the .env file with your database credentials (DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD) and set a unique jwt.secret.

Setup Database

Start Apache and MySQL from your XAMPP/WAMP control panel.

Open phpMyAdmin and create a new database named ci4_react_auth.

Import the schema from the database/database_dump.sql file into your new database.

Start the API Server

Bash

php spark serve
The backend API will be running on http://localhost:8080.

üñ•Ô∏è 2. Frontend Setup (react-auth-client)
Clone the Repository

Bash

git clone <your-frontend-repo-url>
cd react-auth-client
Install Dependencies

Bash

npm install
Start the Application

Bash

npm start
The React application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000. You can now register and log in.
