Full Stack Auth Application (CodeIgniter 4 + React)
This project is a complete full-stack web application featuring a CodeIgniter 4 REST API for the backend and a React.js single-page application for the frontend. It demonstrates user registration, token-based (JWT) authentication, and protected data fetching with a clean, modern UI.

‚ú® Features
Secure User Authentication: Full Register and Login functionality.

Token-Based API: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure API endpoints.

1-to-1 Database Relationship: Demonstrates a relationship between a users table and a teachers profile table.

CRUD Functionality: A single API endpoint to create user and teacher profiles simultaneously.

Data Visualization: Protected pages display user and teacher data in sortable, filterable data tables.

Responsive UI: A clean and creative user interface built with React.

Separated Concerns: Independent backend API and frontend client for better scalability and maintenance.
